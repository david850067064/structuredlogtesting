===== StructuredLogTestingSDK Examples =====

Projects do not include FlexBuilder project files.  There might be
a build.xml and build.properties file provided for some projects.

You should be able to tell what kind of project each example is by
looking for file with the example's name, ie: *.mxml files (Flex), 
*.mxml with a *.xml file (AIR), or just a *.as (ActionScript).  

Here is a list for reference:

BasicSLogViewerAIR - AIR project
BasicTargetUsageAS - ActionScript project
BasicTargetUsageFlex - Flex project
StructuredLogTestingExample1 - Flex project
